        Lamb Rogan Josh is a popular dish originating from the Indian subcontinent, specifically in the region of Kashmir. It is
        made with tender pieces of boneless lamb that are slow-cooked in a rich, aromatic sauce made from a blend of spices,
        tomatoes, and heavy cream. The key spices in a traditional Rogan Josh recipe include paprika, cumin, coriander, garam
        masala, cayenne pepper, turmeric, cardamom, and cinnamon. The result is a savory and flavorful dish that is both warming
        and comforting. It is typically served with rice or bread and is a popular main course option for special occasions and
        family dinners.
